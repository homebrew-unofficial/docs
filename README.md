# docs

[homebrew-unofficial](https://github.com/homebrew-unofficial) manages a collection of unofficial Homebrew formulae.

## Why?

Some awesome tools don't provide their own Homebrew formulae, so this organization provides the formulae instead of the authors.

## Note

The organization icon made by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/).
